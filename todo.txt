Server:
	- Modify servConn so that instead of having a -single- buffer, it
	calloc's an array of buffers (one for each thread that will be
	accepting client connections). Then each "accept" is dispatched
	to a thread (as opposed to fork'ing a child as is done currently).
	
	- Threads communicating with clients will parse their requests,
      and pass them along to threads in a threadpool shared amongst
	  all the threads that talk to clients (protected by
      worker_pool_mutex). 

	  - define a function to parse client commands
	  - define the functions start_movie, stop_movie, and seek_movie


General:
-add destroy routines!

Thread Pool:
-Go through and add error checking to calloc's 
-Add thread_pool_destroy
